### Ansible Playbook: Remote control


Prerequsite ~
- Create an EC2 instance with instance-type: ubuntu
  (because exercise is using with ubuntu command)

- download pem file of created EC2 instance 
  (for me: I save that key under same directory since it would be deleted after exercise is successful.)

- please check aws cli is configure with same region as created instance
